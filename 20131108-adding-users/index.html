<p style="margin-left: 0; margin-top:25px;">So, you have your DSP setup and an idea for an awesome app, now what?
	Well, unless you are type that likes to be the sole beneficiary of your work and/or you like working all by your lonesome,
	then you are going to need to get other people in the mix.
</p>

<p>Whether its adding consumers, collaborators, or customers, DreamFactory DSP provides several ways to add users to your DSP.
	Once added, you control what they can do by provisioning their role-based accesses.
</p>

<p>The following is a quick summary of the supported ways in which you can get more users on your DSP.
	For more information on user and role-based configuration, see our documentation.
</p>

<section id="system-admin" class="flush-left">

	<H2>For The Control Freak In All Of Us</H2>

	<p>The administrator account on your DSP has complete control over how users are added to the system.
		By default, only those with system administrator privileges can add users to the system.
		This is the most restrictive case. A system administrator logs into the DSP,
		goes to the admin view by selecting the gear in the upper right,
		selects the <strong>User</strong> section from the menu at left, and clicks <strong>Create New User</strong>.
	</p>

	<figure>

		<figcaption>Figure 1: Create User Screen</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Select the system administrator checkbox or the desired role,
		select whether or not you want to activate this user for access via login,
		and finally, to assign the password directly, select "Skip email confirmation..." and set the desired password.
		You can return to this user to change the password directly later if needed.
		Similarly, an admin can send a request to the REST API to create a user by posting the similar data to
		/rest/system/user as follows.
	</p>

	<figure>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
	curl -X POST https://dsp-mydsp.cloud.dreamfactory.com/rest/system/user/ \
	-H 'X-DreamFactory-Application-Name: admin' \
	-d ' \
	{ \
		"display_name":"Joe Smith", \
		"first_name":"Joe", \
		"last_name":"Smith", \
		"email":"joe.smith@acme.com", \
		"phone":"555-666-7777", \
		"is_active":true, \
		"is_sys_admin":false, \
		"role_id":1, \
		"password":"password" \
	}'
			</pre>
		<figcaption>Example 1: cURL command and payload for creating a user with password</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Note that using this part of the REST API requires a valid session from an administrator account.
		Also note that the password can only be set and never retrieved via the API for security reasons.
	</p>

	<p>This is useful for creating consumer accounts for things like other web server or test account access,
		or for creating specific users with default passwords, which they can change later.
	</p>

</section>

<section id="invite-friends" class="flush-left">

	<H2>Invite Only the Friends You Really Like</H2>

	<p>In the aforementioned example of adding a user, for "real person" user accounts,
		the system admin is usually not concerned with directly managing user's passwords.
		A more popular way to add users would be to invite them and let them manage their own passwords.
		In this case, the admin still creates the user with email address, role, etc, but does not set a password.
		This user is created in a suspended state until a password is set.
	</p>

	<p>If a default email service is setup, the email service can be used to notify the user via their email address
		that they are invited to the system. That user can then go to your DSP and complete the password requirement.
		Keep reading for more on the email service and password reset capabilities of the DSP.
	</p>

</section>

<section id="sign-up" class="flush-left">

	<H2>Sign Me Up</H2>

	<p>So maybe you have developed an app and want more of an open approach to adding users,
		no individual invites or manual data entry, but you still want to know who they are
		and control their access via roles, etc. Well, that is what we call <strong>Open Registration</strong>.
		This feature, once enabled, gives visitors to your DSP the opportunity to sign up to be a user
		and access your app and services.
	</p>

	<p>To enable Open Registration, a system administrator logs into the DSP,
		goes to the admin view by selecting the gear in the upper right,
		selects the <strong>Config</strong> section from the bottom of the menu at left,
		and checks the "Allow open registration" checkbox.
	</p>

		<figcaption>Figure 2: Configure open registration via UI</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Once selected, you will see the option to assign every new user who comes in through the registration process
		a default role. Obviously you will want to limit what the users can do at first and then possibly
		upgrade them later to a different role that allows for more permissions.
	</p>
	<figure>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
	curl -X PUT https://dsp-mydsp.cloud.dreamfactory.com/rest/system/config/ \
	-H 'X-DreamFactory-Application-Name: admin' \
	-d '{ "allow_open_registration": true, "open_reg_role_id": 1 }'
			</pre>
		<figcaption>Example 2: Configure open registration via REST API</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Refresh the Launchpad view and you will see a new button called <strong>Create Account</strong>.
		Clicking this button will take you to a page to sign up for an account.

		<figcaption>Figure 3: Launchpad with Open Registration enabled</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>By default, when Open Registration is enabled, email validation for registration is disabled. This means that
		the user that wants to sign up gives their email address, etc. and password all in one shot without any kind
		of verification.

	<p>This is useful when you don't really care if the email/username is a valid email or not.
		In most cases, especially where the email address is used for other contact purposes, you will want to
		validate the email address given. To do this, go back to the Open Registration configuration and see the
		"Select an email service..." section. Select an email service from the drop down list.
		Note that a default email service comes with your DSP, but you may wish to add or change its configuration
		to meet your needs. See our documentation for <strong>Services</strong> options. The system comes with a
		default email template internally. To customize, create your own template at the bottom of this configuration
		screen and select it here. More on email templates can be found in our documentation.

	<p>With this configuration, no password is required initially. Once registered, an email is sent,

<section id="password-reset" class="flush-left">

	<H2>A word about passwords...</H2>

	<p>On the <strong>Config</strong> screen mentioned early, you may have seen a <strong>Password Reset</strong>
		section. By default, password resets are performed using a security question and answer setup that can be
		provisioned via a user's profile (see the user icon on the LaunchPad bar once logged in).
		However, very much like Open Registration, if you would like a more secure way to handle password resets,
		you can enable email confirmation by selecting an email service and optionally a template.

<section id="oauth-setup" class="flush-left">

	<H2>Ticket Please</H2>

	<p>As with many websites today, sometimes it is easier if someone else handles the user confirmation and
		password maintenance, like the most popular social or enterprise websites. For these cases,
		DreamFactory can be configured to allow access via an OAuth service. This is currently tied to
		Open Registration being activated. Once provisioned, your allowed OAuth services will show up on
		the login screen. For more information on OAuth provisioning, see this blog.
	</p>

</section>

<section id="guest-access" class="flush-left">

	<H2>The Door's Open, Come On In</H2>

	<p>There may be some functionality in your app that you want everyone to see or be able to use.
		If that is the case, we have a configuration for that as well. It is called <strong>Guest Users</strong>.
		Again, on the config screen in the admin view, there is a place to allow guest access and assign them
		a specific restrictive access role.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img class="shrink" src="//raw.github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-blog-posts/master/20131108-adding-users/Guest_Config.png">

	curl -X PUT https://dsp-mydsp.cloud.dreamfactory.com/rest/system/config/ \
	-H 'X-DreamFactory-Application-Name: admin' \
	-d '{ "allow_guest_user": true, "guest_role_id": 1 }'
			</pre>
		<figcaption>Example 2: Configure guest user via REST API</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Once enabled, you will see that when accessing your DSP, you are not immediately met with a login prompt,
		but the <strong>Sign In</strong> button (and optionally a Create Account button) are also there allowing
		returning users to gain access as their assigned role.
