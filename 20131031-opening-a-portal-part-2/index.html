			<p style="margin-top:25px;">This post picks up where part 1 left off... I apologize for the delay. My original post was too long so I split it into two parts. In
				reviewing the second installment, I realized that the concepts were a bit vague and would be better conveyed through an actual application.</p>

			<p>Thus, the <strong>Portal Sandbox</strong> was born! The full source code is available on
				<a href="https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/portal-sandbox" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Go ahead and clone a copy so you can follow along. I'll wait...</p>

			<H2>First Installment Recap & Checklist</H2>

			<p>So in <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.dreamfactory.com/blog/bid/341114/OAuth-Tutorial-Part-One">Using OAuth with the New Portal Service</a>, I introduced the
				concept of the portal. As you will most certainly recall, the new <strong>Portal</strong> service provides centralized access to authenticated services and API on a
				per-user basis.
				To use the portal service, you must create <strong>Providers</strong>, or endpoints; and any associated keys for said provider(s).

				<section class="callout warning-block"><h4>Pssst...</h4>

					<p>Currently, the portal service only supports providers who accept OAuth 2 authentication. LDAP and OpenID are next to be integrated. In any case, if your
						provider
						authenticates via OAuth 2 you can access it via the portal service. With that said, for the purposes of this blog, Facebook's
						<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/" target="_blank">Graph API</a> was chosen for the example provider.</p>
				</section>

			<p>When a user authenticates with a <strong>provider</strong>, the returned access credentials (an OAuth token in the case of Facebook) are encrypted and stored in the
				<strong>ProviderUser</strong> resource. These are accessible via the DSP's REST API using the <code>/rest/system/provider</code> and
				<code>/rest/system/provider_user</code> endpoints respectively. The following flow chart in figure 1 shows the process in broad strokes.</p>

			<p style="clear:both;">Confused? Don't be, it'll all become quite clear once we fire up the sandbox. With that said, let's recap the key concepts and make sure you've
				got
				all your ducks in a row.</p>

			<h4>Key Concepts from Part One:</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>The new <strong>Portal</strong> service provides your DSP with access to authenticated services and APIs on a per-user basis.</li>

				<li>No providers are supplied with the DSP. You must create them yourself. And, if you want to play along at home, you must register as a Facebook developer (if
					you're
					not already), and create a new application for your DSP's portal. Go back
					and read part one for info on how this is done.

					<section class="callout highlight-block"><h4>Say What?!</h4>

						<p>Yes, sadly, no UI currently exists to manipulate providers or provider users. This will be available in a future update (at the time of this
							writing the current version is <a href="https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core" target="_blank">1.3.3</a>). So, you will need to create your
							providers through one of
							myriad methods including, but not limited to: curl, PHP script, in-browser REST clients, and/or IDE REST clients.</p>

						<p>Here is a handy-dandy JSON template to use with your favorite client.</p>

					<pre class="prettyprint">
{
	"api_name":          "fbportal",
	"provider_name":     "Facebook",
	"is_active":         true,
	"is_system":         false,
	"is_login_provider": false,
	"config_text":       {
		"client_id":     "<strong>PUT YOUR CLIENT ID HERE</strong>",
		"client_secret": "<strong>PUT YOUR CLIENT SECRET HERE</strong>",
		"scope":         [
			"user_about_me",
			"email",
			"user_birthday",
			"user_groups"
		]
	}
}
</pre>
						<p>Just be sure to replace the <strong>PUT YOUR CLIENT... HERE</strong> strings with actual values before you send the POST.</p>
						<section class="callout warning-block">
							<h4>Breaking Change Notice</h4>

							<h5 style="margin-left:0;">If you created this provider previously, please note the following change:</h5>

							<p>The <code>provider.provider_name</code>
								value must be changed from <strong>Facebook Portal</strong> (from part one tutorial) to <strong>Facebook</strong> as shown in the template above.
								This field's value must
								match a provider template from the Oasys library. Currently, Oasys supports Facebook, GitHub,
								Salesforce, and a few others. If it is already set to Facebook, you're good to go.</p>
						</section>

					</section>
				</li>

				<li>Each call to a portal service is relayed verbatim (less any DSP-specific parameters) to the provider.
					<section class="callout changed-block"><h2>A Real-World Example</h2>

						<p>Here is an actual portal call to retrieve the current user's profile from Facebook:</p>
						<pre class="prettyprint">https://dsp-yours.cloud.dreamfactory.com/rest/portal/fbportal/<span class="str">me?app_name=admin</span></pre>
						<p>The portal service translates this call into:</p>
						<pre class="prettyprint">https://graph.facebook.com/<span class="str">me?access_token=&lt;user's token inserted here for you&gt;</span></pre>
						<p>The service makes this request, which is an HTTP GET, and returns the results:</p>
						<pre class="prettyprint">

	"result": {

					</section>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>That pretty much sums it up. In this installment, we are going to use the portal service to get some data.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="portal-sandbox" class="flush-left">
			<H2>Enter Sandbox (We're off to never never-land)</H2>

			<p>Besides finding free time to write, the major reason for the delay of this installment was software development. I wanted to provide a working application that used
				the portal service. In addition, I wanted to be able to build upon this example application for future blog posts. The end result is a small application called the
				<strong>Portal Sandbox</strong>.</strong> </p>

			<p>The full source code is available on GitHub here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/portal-sandbox">https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/portal-sandbox</a>
			</p>

			<p>If you've worked with the DSP API much, I'd wager that it was in Javascript/HTML with AJAX. This application, however, is a bit of a hybrid. It piggy-backs on the
				DSP's
				server core to leverage direct database access via the <strong>ResourceStore</strong> object from our PHP Platform SDK.</p>
			<section class="callout highlight-block">
				<h4>The ResourceStore and Custom Resources</h4>

				<p>In my next blog I will be writing about the ResourceStore and how to extend it to add business rules to your resources. The <strong>Portal Sandbox</strong> will
					be utilized to add some logic around <a href="http://salesforce.com" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> data manipulation.</p>
			</section>

			<p>If you want to play along at home, you need to clone the Portal Sandbox app repo into your DSP's <code>/web</code> directory. This application will not work if
				installed into
				the default "application" space. The reason being is that no server-side code is currently executed if stored there. Only straight-up HTML is rendered and thus,
				only client-side code is available. <code>/web</code> is your DSP's <a target="_blank" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#documentroot">document
					root</a> directory. Once you've cloned the app, add it to your DSP via the Admin console as a remote URL application and set the URL to <code>/portal-sandbox/index.html</code>.
			</p>

			<p>Please note that this application must be run on a stand-alone (i.e. <a href="https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/platform-packages" target="_blank">platform
				package</a> or <a target="_blank"
								  href="http://bitnami.com/stack/dreamfactory">BitNami
				stack</a>) DSP. Hosted DSPs cannot use this application. If you're a new developer or at a loss here, check out <a href="http://vagrantup.com" target="_blank">Vagrant</a>
				for easy development server management.</p>

			<p>Full installation instructions are as follows:

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Clone and Install</strong></li>
				<ol>
					<li>Change to your DSP's <code>/web</code> directory.</li>
					<li>Issue the clone command: <code>git clone https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/portal-sandbox.git .</code></li>
					<li>Change into the new <code>portal-sandbox</code> directory.</li>
					<li>Issue the following command: <code>php ../../composer.phar install</code></li>
				</ol>
