		<p style="margin-top:0;">We've snuck an extra special treat into our latest release (<a href="https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core/" target="_blank">version
			1.5</a>) of the DreamFactory Services Platform&trade;. This new morsel of awesome is our new
			<a href="https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core/wiki/The-Platform-Event-System" target="_blank">Platform Event and Scripting System</a>. These two new
			built-in services (<code>/rest/system/event</code> and <code>/rest/system/script</code>) allows you, the developer, to a/synchronously listen for, and act
			upon, system events in real-time. That's a lot to digest so enjoy this introduction to the new event services.</p>

		<H2>What Good Are Events?</H2>

		<p>Since the dawn of humankind, events have been a part of our lives. Holidays, birthdays, gatherings, celebrations, keggers in Skred's cave; you name it! Unless you're
			some kind of hermit, you've probably attended an event or two. One annoying thing about events is that you always need a reminder (if you're not eidetic). As our
			technology has strengthened, our reminders, or notifications, have evolved as well. Now we can be notified of upcoming dates, events, parties, and/or cave happenings;
			from our device, social, and organizational networks. It seems to reason that someone would, at some point, blend these "reminders" into software architecture. I'm not
			sure which language had them first, but I remember them first in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal" target="_blank">Delphi</a>, and then in
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(software)" target="_blank">Motif/X-Windows</a>. Pretty much all new software development systems after that had
			some sort of event system. But I digress.</p>

		<p>Events are important because having the system tell you when something is about to, or has, occurred; is a blessing in disguise. Once, long ago dear reader, applications
			were forced to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)" target="_blank">poll</a> for system changes. But we endured until our platforms
			embraced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing)" target="_blank">events</a>. These nuggets of system information, jam-packed full of goodies,
			are sent out by our systems, allow you to build your applications more easily. What's that? Easy you say? Pssshaw!</p>

		<p>No, really, it is easier (if we did a good job implementing our event system ;) ). Consider a typical client-side developer (named Pat). Pat knows javascript and HTML5
			hands-down. But needs a specialized service that checks a remote server for additional authentication information. Perhaps for two-factor checks. But to build a service
			like that -- and incorporate it into the DreamFactory Services Platform&trade; -- can be a daunting task to they who are not one with PHP. This is where events
			rock.</p>

		<p>All Pat really needs to know is when someone is about to log in to the system. At that point the app can make the remote call and either allow or deny the operation.
			This login notification is one of many possible system <strong>events</strong>. The particular one that would be useful in this case is called
			<strong>session.login</strong>. So, Pat's app registers as a listener for this event (<strong>session.login</strong>). When it's triggered by a user logging on, the
			callback Pat registered is called and gives the application a chance to validate, augment, and/or deny the request. And this isn't the only way apps may consume events.
			The new <a href="https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core/wiki/The-Platform-Event-System" target="_blank">Platform Event and Scripting System</a> supports
			handlers written in PHP and server-side javascript (more on this later). In addition, the system can notify applications via HTTP
			POST synchronously or asynchronously. Think about that for a sec... Ok, ready?</p>

		<H2>How Does It Work?</H2>

		<p>The DreamFactory Services Platform&trade; is architected in such a way that we can hook, inject, and augment REST API calls. This feature is
			implemented and demonstrated in the <strong>preProcess()</strong> and <strong>postProcess()</strong> methods of our base service and resource classes. We enhanced this
			system to dispatch events when REST API calls are processed. One of our major design goals was that the platform be merely a dispatcher of events, and not <strong>define</strong>
			them. Yes, the actions performed by the server trigger the events, but the names of these events are virtually ignored by the server.</p>

		<p>We do a similar thing today with our Live API offering . This platform application dynamically </p>
