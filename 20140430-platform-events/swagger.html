	<h3>The Swagger&trade; Affair</h3>

	<p>
		One of the great features of the DSP is the Live API/SDK. This is an application that is provided through the
		DSP admin application. At startup, it looks for any Swagger&trade; configuration files in the known resource,
		model and application paths. For all system-provided resources and services, these files end in <code>.swagger.php</code>.
		Applications and user-defined services can have Swagger&trade; configuration files in either PHP or Javascript. </p>

	<p>
		These files are aggregated and presented in the Live API/SDK application, sorted by service. Once you expand a
		service, the operations provided are displayed. A user may then read the documentation and explore each API
		call. In addition, and this is cool part, the user can put all the arguments for any call into this application
		and the REST call will be made, and the results displayed.</p>

	<p>Clicking the above option opens and loads the operations available by service. Clicking a service will expand and
		display the operations available. For instance, figure 2 shows the new goodies that lie beneath the
		<code>system</code> service.</p>

	<p>So not only can you manipulate events via the new service, we've also enhanced the Live API/SDK app to include
		the name of events that will fire for each call. In figure 3, if a call is associated with an event, it will be
		displayed under the implementation notes.</p>
