	<h1 class="ninja">Turn It Up To Eleven!</h1>

	<p style="margin-top:0; font-style: oblique;">Your DSP can be configured to use any web server you want. The core package ships with configuration examples for
		<a href="http://apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache</a> as well
		as <a href="http://nginx.org/" target="_blank">nginx</a>. This guide will show you how to transform your ordinary, default Apache/pre-fork DSP into a shiny new
		nginx/FPM
		DSP! Sound cool? It is!</p>

	<section class="callout callout-right warning-block">
		<h3>Web Server Selection and Free-Hosted DSPs</h3>

		<p>Unfortunately, at this time, you cannot change the web server on a free-hosted or Bitnami-installed DSP. If you want to
			experience all the joy of the nginx, you'll need to be running your
			<a href="https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core/" target="_blank">own private DSP</a>.</p>
	</section>
</section>

<section class="flush-left">
	<H2>Assumptions && Prerequisites</H2>

	<p>This guide assumes you're running the latest <a href="https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core/" target="_blank">DreamFactory Services Platformâ„¢</a> and on a major
		linux distribution (Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat, Debian), or a derivative thereof. The DSP can be a virtual machine on your dev box, a <a href="http://vagrantup.com/"
																																			  target="_blank">vagrant box</a>, or
		even an actual, physical server.
		Other distributions may need tweaking to locations. But the configuration options should the same. It is also assumed (and required) that you have sudo access to your DSP's
		server.</p>

	<p>Remember, that this will not work with free-hosted or Bitnami stack installations. Only self-installed versions are supported.</p>
</section>

<section class="flush-left">
	<H2>Installation</H2>

	<p>If you've already installed the necessary packages, you can skip ahead to the next part.</p>

	<p>We need to install two main packages to get this going. The first is the <a href="http://nginx.org/" target="_blank">nginx</a> server package. The second is
		<a href="http://php-fpm.org/" target="_blank">PHP FPM</a>, or FastCGI Process Manager, package. Check out the
		link if you're not familiar with it.</p>

	<section>
		<h3>Install nginx</h3>

		<p>We are going to install the <code>nginx-extras</code>
			package for this guide. It is a package that requires the nginx server as well as a few extras we need:</p>

		<figure>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">$ sudo apt-get install nginx-extras</pre>
		</figure>

		<p>When that's done you'll have a nice new <code>/etc/nginx</code>
			directory to play with.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Install PHP FPM</h3>

		<p>The second package we need is the PHP FPM package. Install it like this:</p>

		<figure>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">$ sudo apt-get install php5-fpm</pre>
		</figure>

		<p>After it's installed, we need to copy a file from the DSP to the PHP FPM directory. It's detailed in the Configuration section below.</p>
	</section>
</section>

<section class="flush-left">
	<h2>Configuration</h2>

	<p>The <strong>VERY</strong> first thing you <em>should</em> do is make a copy of the <strong>nginx</strong> installation. You can do this easily:</p>

	<figure>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">$ mkdir ~/nginx && sudo cp -r /etc/nginx/* ~/nginx</pre>
	</figure>

	<p>That will come in handy someday when you break your server. Trust me. ;)</p>

	<p>Now we can start fiddling in the configs. We need to copy a few files from your DSP installation directory.</p>

	<section class="callout changed-block">
		<h4>Your Current Directory</h4>

		<p>For the purpose of this guide, we will assume you are in your DSP's root directory. All paths shown will be relative from there.</p>
	</section>

	<p>First the PHP FPM file:</p>

	<figure>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ sudo cp config/external/php/etc/php5/mods-available/dreamfactory.ini /etc/php5/mods-available/
$ sudo php5enmod dreamfactory
$ sudo service php5-fpm restart
php5-fpm stop/waiting
php5-fpm start/running, process 15113
		</pre>
	</figure>

	<p>Cool beans. Now we copy the nginx files:</p>

	<figure>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ sudo cp config/external/nginx/etc/nginx/dsp-locations.conf /etc/nginx/
$ sudo cp config/external/nginx/etc/nginx/sites-available/* /etc/nginx/sites-available/
$ sudo cp -r config/external/nginx/etc/nginx/conf.d/* /etc/nginx/conf.d/
		</pre>
	</figure>

	<section>
		<h3>What Have I Done?!</h3>

		<p>The files copied above are building blocks and do not overwrite anything that is owned by nginx. Here's a quick rundown of what they are:</p>

		<p><code>dsp-locations.conf</code> is included by the files in <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available</code> to configure the web server's routes.</p>

		<p><code>/etc/nginx/sites-available</code> now has two new files: <code>dsp.single.local</code> and <code>dsp.multi.local</code>. These both do the same thing in different
			ways.</p>

		<section class="callout highlight-block">
			<h4>What are these files?</h4>

			<p>These files configure nginx to listen for web connections and send it to PHP. If you're going to use SSL on your site we recommend you use the
				<code>dsp.single.local</code> file as your configuration. The <strong>single</strong> file runs the DSP in a single <strong>server</strong> section of the nginx
				configuration. If you're not running SSL, or not yet at least, the <strong>multi</strong> file has a <strong>server</strong> configuration for HTTP and HTTPS
				separated.
				You can comment out the HTTPS section if you do not want to use SSL.</p>
		</section>

		<p>In <code>/etc/nginx/conf.d</code> there are few new files: <code>dreamfactory.http.conf</code> and <code>dreamfactory.php-fpm.conf</code>. These configure nginx for PHP
			FPM
			and set a few defaults. Please read through them if you've not already. They're commented and you can change to your liking. That goes pretty much for all these config
			files.</p>

		<p>In addition, there a new directory called <code>ssl</code> in which there is a file called <code>dreamfactory.ssl.conf</code>. If you're going to run SSL you just need
			to
			put the location of your keys into that file. If you're not running SSL it is ignored. This is placed in a separate place so it can be made as secure as you require.
		</p>

		<section class="callout changed-block">
			<h4>SSL Configuration File Location</h4>

			<p>You can adjust the source of the include from <code>conf.d/ssl/</code> to anything you want. We'll cover that in a bit.</p>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3 id="nginx-conf">nginx.conf</h3>

		<p>The last file we need to copy is the <code>nginx.conf</code> file. This step is optional. You might not want to copy this file over the default configuration without
			giving
			a good perusal.</p>

		<p>We have found these settings to be generally good and many thanks to the gentleman referenced in that configuration file for those settings. There aren't any settings in
			our
			version of <code>nginx.conf</code> that are required to run the DSP properly. It is just tuned for speed. (thanks to that dude...).</p>

		<p>So copy it if you want:</p>

		<figure>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ sudo cp config/external/nginx/etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/
		</pre>
		</figure>
	</section>
</section>

<section>
	<h3 id="choose-your-destructor">Choose Your Destructor</h3>

	<p>If you haven't decided by now if you're going to use the <strong>single</strong> or <strong>multi</strong> configuration files outlined above, go with the multi. Either way,
		you need to create a new configuration for your DSP using one of the two samples. We're going to use the single version and call it <code>dsp.local</code>:</p>

	<figure>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
$ sudo cp dsp.single.local dsp.local
		</pre>
	</figure>

	<p>Go on in the new file (<code>dsp.local</code>) with your favorite editor and change anything that calls out to you. Your DSP root directory perhaps, the server name, port,
		etc. Make sure you test your changes before restarting nginx by using the following command:</p>

	<figure>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ sudo nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
		</pre>
	</figure>

	<p>If you messed up, you'll get this fail:</p>

	<figure>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ sudo nginx -t
nginx: [emerg] unknown directive "included" in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:140
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed
		</pre>
	</figure>

	<section class="callout changed-block">
		<h3 class="ninja">Ninja Tip!</h3>

		<p>When you're in <em>DGM</em> (deep geek mode), having to type <code>sudo service nginx restart</code> two or three times a minute gets old. So create an alias to do the
			typing for you!</p>

		<p>I run Ubuntu and <strong>bash</strong> is the shell that I use. When you log in, or open a terminal window, <strong>bash</strong>
			<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x237.html" target="_blank">sources</a>
			your
			<code>~/.bash_aliases</code>
			file. If you don't have one, you can create one and it will automatically be sourced upon next and future logins.</p>

		<p>Here are a few of the things in my <code>~/.bash_aliases</code> file for these types of situations. Feel free to add them to your arsenal.</p>

		<figure>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
alias a2off='sudo service apache2 graceful-stop'
alias a2on='sudo service apache2 start'
alias a2rl='sudo service apache2 reload'
alias a2rs='sudo service apache2 restart'

alias ngtrs='sudo nginx -t && sudo service nginx restart'
alias ngtrl='sudo nginx -t && sudo service nginx reload'
alias ngtoff='sudo nginx -t && sudo service nginx stop'
alias ngton='sudo nginx -t && sudo service nginx start'
			</pre>

<section>
	<h2>Enable the DSP Server</h2>

	<p>The nginx server ships with a default server configuration (in <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/default</code>), which is enabled.</p>

	<p>If you're not using (going to use) it, you should disable it:</p>

	<figure>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
		</pre>
	</figure>

	<p>Now we need to <strong>enable</strong> the DSP, done via symbolic link:</p>

	<figure>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/dsp.local /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dsp.local</pre>
	</figure>

	<p>What we're doing is symlinking the <code>sites-available</code>
		configuration into the <code>sites-enabled</code> directory. Now we test the configuration before restarting the service:</p>

	<figure>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
$ sudo nginx -t
$ sudo service nginx restart
		</pre>
	</figure>

	<p>If you want to disable the DSP from nginx, just unlink the symbolic link we just created:</p>

	<figure>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">$ sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dsp.local</pre>
	</figure>

	<section>
		<h3 id="restart">Restart the Server</h3>

		<p>Restart nginx now</p>

		<figure>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">$ sudo service nginx restart</pre>
		</figure>
	</section>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>All Done!</h2>

	<p>Now you can test out your DSP on nginx. Please let us know how your experiences compare using nginx vs. Apache, or any other server for that matter!</p>

	<p>I'll be posting an update to this soon with benchmarks between the DSP on Apache vs. nginx. That should be interesting.</p>
